                    Hello! My name is Sabrina Chang and I am from Taipei, Taiwan.
                      I enjoy watching TV series and listening music.  
                      I am also a working mom who work in memory foam mattress and adjustable. 
                       I have two teens kids and a lovely husband. I really enjoy to spend time with family. 
                       Recently, I joined a homestay family plan. Now, we have a Austrlia girl lives with us. 
                       She is special to Taiwanese, because she sleeps very early. 
                       She sleeps at 8 p.m. Our family sleeping time usually is at midnight. 
                       She just stays 3 weeks for learning Chinese. 
                       I am practicing my English at least an hour per day with her. 
                       We are very appreciated she comes into our life!
                </p>

                <p>Taipei, officially Taipei City, is the capital and a special municipality of Taiwan. 
                    Located in Northern Taiwan, Taipei City is an enclave of the municipality of New Taipei City that sits about 25 km (16 mi) southwest of the northern port city of Keelung. 
                    Most of the city rests on the Taipei Basin, an ancient lakebed. The basin is bounded by the relatively narrow valleys of the Keelung and Xindian rivers, which join to form the Tamsui River along the city's western border. - wiki
